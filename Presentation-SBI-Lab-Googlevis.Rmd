# Introduction

This is an introduction ..... 

<!-- Talk about how Data Science gives you super power .... -->

<!-- Mention why Data Science is important ... Say something about visualization -->



## GoogleVis Demo: Motion Chart + World Bank Data

This demo shows how country level data can be accessed from the World Bank via their API and displayed with a Motion Chart

Process breakdown:

<!-- Explain -->


## Install packages


R has more than 10,000 packages including  **GoogleVis**

googleVis package
RJSONIO package -  Reads JSON data into R

## Connect to World Bank API

<!-- Add code -->


API - can access data from the World Bank in R

You can have the world's data in your pocket with the data sets of the World Bank,

World Bank provides us with a page which lists all indicator variables



| Indicator | Key |
|:--------------------:|:--------------:|
| fertility rate | SP.DYN.TFRT.IN |
| life expectancy | SP.DYN.LE00.IN |
| population | SP.POP.TOTL |
| GDP per capita (US$) | NY.GDP.PCAP.CD |

## Merge various data sets to get the final table. 

<!-- Show final table -->

<!-- Talk about data set - how many countries, size of data, years, etc ... -->

## Create motion chart



```{r cars}



```

<!-- Run visualization and explain -->


## Show motion Chart for 4 different sceneraios

1) Fertility Rate x Life Expectancy - highest life expectancies are .... 
<!-- Japan, etc ... -->

Each buble is a country and the size of the bubble is the populaiton of that country. Shows  different colors for regions blue for asia. track China - it's life expectancy is growing as fertility rate are declining and it can be traced to  its  1968-69 one child policy

2) GDP x Fertility Rate - change scale to log on Y (GDP) change colors to unique --- GDP is growing as Fertility rates are declining showing and inverse relationship between these 2 variables - Shows GPD growth for China / India since 60's
There is an inverse relationship between Fertily rates and GDP

3) GDP x Population -  Shows Trade of between population and GDP - bouncing in place showing population relatively stable while their GDP shows fluctuations


4) GDP x Life Expectancy - Larger GDP equates to higher life expectancy. Cambodia Genocide in the late 70's and when it's over it takes off. Rwanda drops to about 25 year
